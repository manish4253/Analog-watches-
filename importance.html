<h2 id="sh3" align="center">Why You Should Start Wearing A Wrist Watch?   </h2>

<div style="margin:25px;">

<h2 id="sh3"> 1. Watches Are Convenient </h2>

<p id="sp">    Phones don’t keep you punctual. Watches do.
<br>
A wrist watch is the most convenient way to tell the time.
<br>
I don’t need a watch because I have a phone, is a common response from a generation who are now questioning the adverse effects of constant cellphone use. Fishing for a cell phone on regular occasions just to check the time looks desperate.
</p>

<h2 id="sh3"> 2. Watches Are Functional     
</h2>

<p id="sp">Any item inspired by the military has a functional use. Wrist watches included.

Wrist watches were first used in the 19th century by the military to synchronize maneuvers during war. Since then, specialized watches have been used in the depths of the ocean by divers and high up in the sky by aviators.
</p>

<h2 id="sh3"> 3. Watches Provide Simplicity  </h2>

<p id="sp">The best watches don’t use the latest technology. They are powered by ingenious mechanical clockwork technology that predates electricity. So when your cellphone runs out battery – you can trust the technology that keeps running on your wrist.
</p>

<h2 id="sh3"> 4. Watches Signal Style     </h2>

<p id="sp">The range of acceptable jewelry for a person is limited. Many people are only going to be seen with three main accessories decorating their hands – a nice watch, a stylish pair of cuff links, and a simple wedding band if they’re married.
<br>
In addition to helping wearers stick to their schedules, wristwatches make it easier for them to display their sense of style. They are a form of self-expression – reflecting hint of danger, adventure and sports depending on the make of the watch.

</p>

<h2 id="sh3">  5. Watches Embody Craftsmanship   </h2>

<p id="sp">A wrist watch is more than a time-keeper. It is a symbol of tradition and history encased in a showpiece with extreme craftsmanship.
<br>
Not many people realize that they are wearing pieces of art on their wrist. Some watch houses have four craftsmen working on one watch for several months – designing complex pieces of technology by hand.</p>
